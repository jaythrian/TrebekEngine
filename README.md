# TrebekEngine
A text based trivia game engine named after the late Alex Trebek

Trivia Game Q/A's are must be stored in files with "tb" file format

As of right now, answers have to be one word

Formating must be corret! ;)

## Formating for QA.tb files
Every question/answer set is stored in "{}"

Every question is in "* *"

Individual answers are in "()"

  Except the correct answer which is in []

White space and other characters are ignored

### Example
```
{
* How many fingers does the average human have? * ; (19) (44) [10] (2)
}
```

#### Production is in infancy and has stopped indefinitely
